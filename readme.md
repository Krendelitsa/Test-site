This is my task from courses.

Task:
Make a working chat using all the knowledge that was acquired over the past 10 lessons.
The chat should work on independent browser pages and take into account which of the three users we are currently using.
The user is selected via GET parameter userId
For example http://localhost/index.php?userId=1 should send and receive messages on behalf of the first user
http://localhost/index.php?userId=3 should do the same for the third user.
There must be at least three users, each of them must have a name, an avatar and their own color for displaying the name/text
The user should see which messages are from him and which are not.
Everything should work without reloading the page, but when the page is reloaded the user should not lose the chat history.
